The sole purpose of filmmaking is to create content that spurs emotions, captivates audiences, or prompts action. It is an event that aspires to promote and inspire the work of budding filmmakers with the slogan \"Pick Your Camera, Flaunt your Creativity\". And this year, Synergy, in association with Parvaaz, presents you with an opportunity to bring your story to life and showcase your technical skills with <eventName>, a filmmaking competition. <eventName> is a chance for students to stimulate their creative thinking and bring out the art of narration through film making. The best of the entries will be screened at the main event, before a huge audience. So, what are you waiting for? Sign up and make the world see through your lens.",

Ways to enforce this:\n❖	The film will have to be centred around the given theme.\n❖	The groups will be asked to place a fixed prop/symbol in the background of a few shots (eg: The ‘Synergy’/IIITB logo has to be present somewhere in the frame in at least 3 different locations and for a total time of at least 8 seconds)",
            
            "●	Parvaaz will provide guidance to the participants as and when necessary.\n● The judgement criteria will also include technical aspects of filmmaking like editing, cinematography, sound design, etc.\n● The best films out of all the submissions will be nominated and screened in the auditorium during the main event.\n● The audience of this screening will also be able to vote online after each short film, and this vote will be a part of the overall judging criteria.\n●	Based on the number of entries, we will take a call on whether there should be multiple categories (eg: phone, amateur, professional) and the preferred medium of shooting will be asked in the entry forms.\n●	Judges with experience in filmmaking will  be brought in from outside"
